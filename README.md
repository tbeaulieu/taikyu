 GARW Dash, SuperTaikyu-inspired

Per usual, to see oil temperature/oil pressure/afr, set the HIGH value greater than zero in the settings, otherwise they are hidden.

This dash will require you to update your gear settings (under settings -> gears) for the calculated gear (unless you're very fancy and running a sequential with a canbus output), the following works decently for me currently with a stock C64:

(1st) 123 (2nd) 83 (3rd) 60 (4th) 47 (5th) 37 (6th) 33
